# Database Security
Some labs in Database Security subject in HCMUS will be exploited. They are about decentralization, access control, hash functions, symmetric keys, asymmetric keys, and so forth.

### Lab 2: The decentralization in MySQL

### Lab 3: The access control method with encrypted datas in MySQL databases

- With personal lab:

The password column was hashed by *MD5*, and the salary column was encrypted by *AES256*. Then write an application to control user access.

- With a group lab, there will be more columns than in the former lab. It's also got access control, like in a in a personal lab, where the password column was hashed by *SHA1* and the salary column was encrypted by *RSA*. In addition, it allows a teacher to modify the information they hold.

### Lab 4: The access control method with encrypted datas before insert to database in MySQL
